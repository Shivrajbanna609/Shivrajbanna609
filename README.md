Hi, Iâ€™m Shivbhadrasinh Sankhat

I am a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student eager to deploy my skills related to 
web development and UI designs in realistic situations. Thus, with the hands-on 
experience of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, I have successfully build responsive 
and dynamic websites along with designing user-friendly interfaces. I like studying new 
technologies and approaches along with savouring problem-solving skills, mainly in a 
group team environment.
